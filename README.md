cytDiv
======

cytoDiv is a R package that calculates ecological diversity indices for a microbial community based on its bio-optical properties measured at the single cell level by flow cytometry. The indices express the organization and structure of a community, its richness in physiological and genetic variations. The equations used to calculate the indices are described in Li, W. 1997 Limnology &amp; Oceanography 42, 874:880
